	<p>I am a software engineer at <a href="http://gettyimages.com/">Getty Images</a> and an avid cyclist.</p>

	<p>I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington (class of 1994). While at UW, I did two internships with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> on the Mac Excel team. I eventually went to Microsoft full-time starting in 1995 where I worked in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live for the next ten years.</p>

	<p>I've always been an <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> fan. My first computer was an Apple IIc. I worked on Mac Excel when I started at Microsoft. Somewhere around 1998 or 1999, I started to look at Linux. I followed that thread in my spare time until at home I was running Linux and Mac OS X with no Windows machines. That seemed like a signal it was time to move on.</p>

	<p>Since leaving Microsoft, I've worked at a few startups (Source Labs, Jobster, Pure Networks) and then Getty Images. I expanded my skills on open source platforms and now work primarily in Ruby on Rails creating web applications and services.</p>
